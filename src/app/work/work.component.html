<h1>Steven's Employment History</h1>

<h2>Corteva Agriscience</h2>
<p>
    I'm currently working for Corteva as an intern in the Data Science & Informatics (DSI) department.
    I will continue to work there through August 16th, then transition to ISU for my Junior year.
    I'm still discussing with my mentor what exactly I can put on this site as far as my work goes,
    but I can tell you I'm working with C# .NET/.NET Core, Azure, and Angular.
